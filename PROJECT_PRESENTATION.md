# Bonkers Bracket Bonanza(?)

Only proceed if you dare ...

For this challange, your task is to write a function called 'sortParenthesis' (in ./main.js). 

The function will accept a string of parenthesis such as the following: '(())()(('

And out put the following string: '()()()((' 

The function should sort out all matching parenthesis and place them at the beginning, all unmatched parenthesis will be placed at the end. 
The function should be able to accept a string of infinite parenthesis, there are 4 tests


#### How to test 

To test your function, please ensure vitest is installed and run the following command in  your terminal while in the root folder:

```bash
npm run test
```

Please note: the first test is a control, if this does not pass then please contact me.


## Bonus challange 

Complete function 'bonusChallange'.

The function will accept a string of parenthesis such as the following: '<span style="color:red;">(</span>()<span style="color:red;">)</span>()(('

And out put the following integer: 1

The function should look for two parenthesis that are facing each other and seperated by two characters, such as: '<span style="color:red;">(</span>)(<span style="color:red;">)</span>'. These are marked in red in these examples. The fucntion should return how many there are as integers.

**Example 1**.Input: '<span style="color:red;">(</span><span style="color:red;">(</span>)<span style="color:red;">)</span><span style="color:red;">)</span>)'. Expected outcome: 2.

Have an idea of how the solution will work 游릴

Decided on how to test - vitest 游릴

Write the read me to determine how the test will work and operate 游릴

install vitest 游릴

add script and add it into instructions 游릴

Write barebones test to see that test passes 游릴

write test 1 - simple 

write test 游릴

test it using a solution so that it passess游릴

test 2 - longer test 

write test 游릴

test it using a solution so that it passess游릴

test 3 - test with unmatched parenthesis

write test 游릴

test it using a solution so that it passess游릴

test 4 - test with unmatched parenthesis

write test 游릴

test it using a solution so that it passess游릴

Repeat with bonus challange
